* Version 1.0.4: Added Data Point Labels and Axis Labels for Line & Bar Charts.
* Version 1.0.3: Added chart title, background color, labels, data color. IE does not look good. I promise I'll work on that. Try Firefox for best results.
* Version 1.0.2: General scrambling associated with an unplanned beta release.
* Version 1.0.1: I accidentally release this to the public before it was ready, so I decided to go ahead and release what I have now. I'm actively developing this, so please leave <a href="http://brockangelo.com/wordpress/plugins/google-chart-generator/">feedback</a>.
* Version 1.0: Very basic version. My goal is to get this thing off the ground as soon as possible.
